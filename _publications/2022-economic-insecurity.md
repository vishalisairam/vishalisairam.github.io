Using experimental and survey data, this research examines the relationship between economic insecurity and social trust. Our findings demonstrate that economic uncertainty systematically increases political polarization while decreasing interpersonal and institutional trust.

**Key Findings:**
- Economic insecurity leads to measurable increases in political polarization
- Trust in institutions declines significantly under conditions of economic uncertainty  
- Effects are consistent across different demographic groups and countries
- Policy implications for social cohesion and democratic stability

**Methodology:**
- Behavioral economics experiments with 1,200+ participants
- Cross-national survey data analysis
- Causal identification using instrumental variables approach
- Robustness checks across multiple model specifications

**Policy Relevance:** This research provides evidence-based insights for policymakers addressing rising polarization and declining trust in democratic societies.
