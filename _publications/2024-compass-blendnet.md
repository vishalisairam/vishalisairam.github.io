This paper presents BlendNet, a novel cloud-edge-satellite platform designed to serve underserved populations through assisted digital distribution. Based on pilot deployment data from ~68,000 users and 250 retailers, we analyze the effectiveness of technology-mediated service delivery in resource-constrained environments.

**Key Contributions:**
- First large-scale analysis of hybrid cloud-edge-satellite deployment in underserved communities
- Empirical evaluation of user adoption patterns and service utilization
- Framework for designing technology solutions for digital divide contexts
- Policy recommendations for scaling digital distribution platforms

**Research Impact:** This work contributes to the growing body of literature on ICT4D (Information and Communication Technologies for Development) and provides practical insights for organizations working to bridge the digital divide.
