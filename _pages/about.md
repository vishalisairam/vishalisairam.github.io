I’m a consultant with the World Bank’s Poverty & Equity Team. I conduct applied quantitative research and policy analysis: India State Profiles dashboards integrating survey and administrative data; GIS/remote-sensing labor-market work using night-lights, road density, and land-use; and contributions to vulnerability indices, CEQ analyses, and welfare-scheme evaluations.

Recent highlights: leading World Bank dashboard initiatives; managing Microsoft Research India’s BlendNet pilot serving 68,000+ users; co-authoring ACM COMPASS 2024; and teaching (Causal Inference, Hertie; Infrastructure, IIM Bangalore), with projects across Germany, India, and Ghana. Education: MPP, Hertie (Helmut Schmidt/DAAD Scholar); Integrated Master’s in Development Studies, IIT Madras (Economics minor).
