Hi, I’m Vishali Sairam — a Consultant Data Scientist and Policy Analyst currently working with the World Bank’s Poverty and Equity Global Practice. I work at the intersection of data, technology, and policy to address complex development challenges.

At the World Bank, I lead and contribute to projects such as:

- State Profiles integrating survey and administrative data into policy dashboards
- GIS-based labor market analysis using nightlight, road, and land-use data for Libya and India
- Impact assessments through CEQ studies, welfare evaluations, and vulnerability indices

Previously, I led the pilot deployment of BlendNet (Microsoft Research), reaching 68,000+ users in low-connectivity regions, and co-authored a paper in ACM COMPASS 2024. I’ve also taught at Hertie School and IIM Bangalore.

I hold an MPP from Hertie School (Berlin), funded by the DAAD Helmut Schmidt Scholarship, and an Integrated Master’s in Development Studies from IIT Madras, with a minor in Economics.
