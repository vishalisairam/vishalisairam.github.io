I’m a Consultant with the World Bank’s Poverty & Equity Team. I conduct applied quantitative research and policy analysis. I currently work on the following: India State Profiles dashboards integrating survey and administrative data; GIS/remote-sensing labor-market work using night-lights, road density, and land-use; and contributions to vulnerability indices, CEQ analyses, and welfare-scheme evaluations.
