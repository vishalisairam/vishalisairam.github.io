Hi, I’m Vishali — an economist and data scientist working at the intersection of policy, data, and applied research. I’m a Consultant at the World Bank, where I use large datasets, spatial models, and statistical methods to study growth and inequality. My work spans labor markets, firms, and regional development, integrating survey, satellite, and administrative data into analytical tools.

Previously, at Microsoft Research, I led research and analytics for BlendNet, a cloud–edge AI platform improving digital content delivery in low-connectivity regions.

I hold a Master’s in Public Policy from the Hertie School (DAAD Helmut Schmidt Scholar) and an Integrated Master’s in Development Studies from IIT Madras.

Interests: economics, policy, technology
