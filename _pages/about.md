Hi! I’m Vishali, an economist and data scientist working at the intersection of economics, data, and applied research. I currently work as a Consultant at the World Bank. My work focuses on using large datasets, spatial models, and statistical methods to understand economic systems and patterns of growth and inequality. I’ve worked on projects involving labor markets, firm dynamics, and regional development, integrating survey, satellite, and administrative data into analytical and visualization tools.

Previously, at Microsoft Research, I worked on BlendNet, a cloud–edge platform that used AI to improve digital content delivery in low-connectivity regions, where I led the research and analytics for the pilot deployment.

I hold a Master’s in Public Policy from the Hertie School, Berlin, as a DAAD Helmut Schmidt Scholar, and an Integrated Master’s in Development Studies from IIT Madras.

I’m interested in economics, technology, and the broader interactions between culture and markets. You can reach me at vishalisairam@gmail.com
