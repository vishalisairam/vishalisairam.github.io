Welcome! I'm Vishali Sairam, a data scientist and policy analyst working with the World Bank's Poverty and Equity Team. I build tools that help policymakers make sense of complex development challenges. Recent projects include interactive dashboards that combine survey and administrative data, and spatial analysis using satellite imagery to study labor markets.

Before joining the World Bank, I contributed to research and product teams across India and Europe. At Microsoft Research India I supported pilot deployments of technology for small retailers, and at the Centre for Digital Governance in Berlin I worked on projects exploring economic insecurity and digital governance. These roles taught me how to bridge technical insight with real-world policy needs.

I hold an MPP from the Hertie School, funded by the Helmut Schmidt Scholarship, and an Integrated Master's in Development Studies from IIT Madras. I enjoy translating data into stories that drive social impact and am always curious about how technology can expand opportunity. If you're interested in collaborating or chatting about data-driven policy, feel free to reach out or connect on LinkedIn.
